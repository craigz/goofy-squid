Your Project
------------

### ← README.md

this site is a test of bringing over projects from the 
closing down thimble. this was a test (remix) i had worked on
there. that was relatively painless. the editor here will be a bit of an adjustment, 
but it's a pretty cool integration and i am keen to play more here.

the only issue i ran into was getting images into the assets folder and getting the list of 
url's where each needed a clck after upload to find the newly assigned url of the image at the cdn. 
keen to start with a blank slate for my next project.
